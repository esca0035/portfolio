# Eimy Escaba - Portfolio

## Project Description
In this project I designed my own web portfolio. I first designed it in User Experience Design class, and I started coding it. The teachers have been very nice with me, they helped me a lot with this projet and I am so thankfull for that, 

### Challenges
While working on this project, I struggled with a lot of stuff, i struggled on how to start it as I get very overwhelemed, I see so much things that I have to do and I get confused on how I can start it. I challenged a lot with the placement of stuff and how I can make them in diffrent sizes.

### Lessons leared

It was a good learning experience, I now underatand how to use bootstrap and how to make a good design. I really like designing it but coding is defenetly the most challenging part so I learned that I should be only a User Experience Designer.
